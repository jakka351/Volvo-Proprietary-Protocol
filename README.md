# Volvo-Proprietary-Protocol
Decoding a Volvo Proprietary Protocol for flashing truck ECUs
***
1. Observing the Message Patterns
You have CAN frames on two IDs:

0x07FF (which appears to be the “request” or “command” ID)
0x07FE (which appears to be the “response” ID)
All frames are 8 bytes of data (classical CAN, not necessarily ISO-TP if each message is truly only 8 bytes). The data patterns look like this (abridged):

Time      ID    Data
-----------------------------------------
07FF Rx   21 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
07FF Rx   40 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
07FE Rx   80 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
07FF Rx   4E 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
07FE Rx   8E 00 00 00 57 77 E0 10
07FE Rx   CE 00 00 00 40 00 00 98
07FE Rx   0E 00 00 00 10 01 20 20
07FF Rx   41 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
07FE Rx   81 54 47 71 82 13 04 3E
07FF Rx   42 33 95 6B 10 12 08 29
07FE Rx   82 33 95 6B 10 12 08 29
07FF Rx   44 01 00 00 00 00 00 00
07FE Rx   84 01 55 00 00 00 00 00
...
07FF Rx   4B 00 00 00 00 80 04 00
07FE Rx   8B 80 BA BE 00 00 00 FF
07FF Rx   4B 00 00 04 00 80 04 00
07FE Rx   8B 80 BA BE 00 00 00 FF
07FF Rx   4B 00 00 08 00 80 04 00
07FE Rx   8B 80 BA BE 00 00 00 FF
...
(repeats with increasing offsets: 0x0C, 0x10, 0x14, etc.)
...
A few notable patterns:

Command/Response Pairing

Many times, the first byte of the “request” (ID 0x07FF) is 0x4X, and the response’s first byte (ID 0x07FE) is 0x8X—the same lower nibble plus 0x80.
Examples:
Request = 4E ... → Response = 8E ...
Request = 4B ... → Response = 8B ...
Request = 44 ... → Response = 84 ...
This strongly suggests the “high bit” (0x80) in the response is a success or “positive response” indicator.
Incrementing 4-Byte Offsets

You see repeating frames 4B 00 00 XX 00 80 04 00 (where XX increments in steps of 4: 00, 04, 08, 0C, 10, ... 90)
The response is nearly the same each time: 8B 80 BA BE 00 00 00 FF.
This pattern looks like a chunked data transfer or an address pointer being incremented in 4-byte steps. Possibly the tool is telling the ECU: “Send me the next chunk” or “I’m sending the next 4-byte chunk.”
“Start” or “Session” Requests

Early messages: 21, 40, 4E, 41, 42, 44, etc., with responses 80, 8E, 81, 82, 84, etc.
The variety of the first nibble (2, 4) in the request might indicate different “commands” or “states,” and setting bit 7 in the response signals acknowledgment.
Possibility of KWP2000/UDS-Like Flow

A typical automotive reflash sequence might be:
Start a diagnostic session (some “start session” command).
Request seeds/keys for security access.
Erase memory or prepare memory.
Download data in chunks.
Request transfer exit or finalize.
While these exact service IDs don’t match standard UDS or KWP, the pattern of “command + 0x80” for a positive response is reminiscent of those protocols.
Therefore, from the logs alone, the high-level protocol might look like:

Initiate session with a couple of commands (e.g., 0x21, 0x40, 0x4E, 0x41, etc.). The ECU responds with 0x80, 0x8E, 0x81...
Once the session is active, you see repeated 0x4B with incremental addresses/offsets, and the ECU replies 0x8B .... That strongly suggests repeated chunk operations (upload/download).
2. A Hypothetical “VolvoBootloaderProtocol” Class in C#
Below is a skeleton C# class showing how one might structure a custom protocol driver if you have access to a low-level CAN interface (e.g., using a .NET CAN driver library such as PeakCAN, Kvaser, Vector, or a SocketCAN wrapper). This is an illustrative example: actual code depends on your hardware API.

namespace VolvoBootloader
{
    public class VolvoBootloaderProtocol
    {
        // These are the CAN IDs we see in logs
        private const int RequestCanId  = 0x07FF;
        private const int ResponseCanId = 0x07FE;

        // You'd have some kind of CAN interface here
        // (Pseudo-interface; replace with your actual CAN I/O)
        private readonly ICanInterface _can;

        public VolvoBootloaderProtocol(ICanInterface canInterface)
        {
            _can = canInterface;
        }

        /// <summary>
        /// Example method to start the session
        /// </summary>
        public bool StartSession()
        {
            // 1) Send a frame that looks like 21 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
            // (Hypothesis: "0x21" might be "Start Diagnostics" or "Open Bootloader"?)

            byte[] startSessionPayload = { 0x21, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00 };
            _can.SendFrame(RequestCanId, startSessionPayload);

            // 2) Wait for a response on 0x07FE, something like 80 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
            var resp = WaitForResponse(ResponseCanId, 1000); // 1 second timeout
            if (resp == null)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("No response to StartSession");
                return false;
            }

            // Check the first byte for 0x80 (which might be “positive acknowledgment” of 0x21)
            if (resp[0] == 0x80)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Session started successfully!");
                return true;
            }
            else
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"Session start rejected: {BitConverter.ToString(resp)}");
                return false;
            }
        }

        /// <summary>

            // Let's break that into:
            //   0x4B - the command
            //   0x00 0x00 offsetLow offsetHigh ...
            //   This is guesswork – the real meaning depends on the actual format.

            // For example, if offset must go in the 4th byte:
            byte offsetLow  = (byte)(offset & 0xFF);
            byte offsetHigh = (byte)((offset >> 8) & 0xFF);

            // Build the frame:
            byte[] data = new byte[8];
            data[0] = 0x4B;     // Command
            data[1] = 0x00;

Notes on the Example
StartSession()

Sends 0x21 … (from the logs) and expects 0x80 … back.
You would replicate this idea for the other “start” or “session config” frames, such as 0x40, 0x4E, 0x41, etc.
SendDataChunk(uint offset)

Demonstrates how you might package the “4B” command with a changing offset.
In the logs, the 4th byte is incrementing by 4. We treat that as the low byte of an address offset. (You might need to handle endianness or 32-bit addresses differently in real code.)
Positive Acknowledgment

In many cases, the response is 0x8B … if everything is OK (the high bit set).
Real-World Variation

Actual protocols might use ISO-TP (transport protocol) if the data payload goes beyond 8 bytes. However, these logs show only single CAN frames of 8 bytes each—so it’s likely a simple request/response in 8-byte chunks.
Some commands might need seeds/keys or checksums (like security access). The data bytes 57 77 E0 10, BA BE, 00 FF might be memory addresses, checksums, or security tokens.
3. Wrapping Up
Pattern: The high bit (0x80) in the first response byte often indicates a positive acknowledgment to the request’s lower nibble (0x0X, 0x4X, etc.).
Incrementing Bytes: The repeated 4B / 8B exchange with a 4-byte increment is a strong sign of chunk-based data reads/writes or memory address increments.
Implementation: A typical approach is to create a C# “driver” class that:
Sends known commands (e.g., 0x21, 0x40, 0x4E, 0x4B, etc.).
Waits for the corresponding “0x80 + nibble” or “0x8X” response.
Interprets success/failure from the response.
Proceeds with the next step in the flashing routine.
Because this is proprietary and we only have a snippet of the traffic logs, the above code is a framework to help you get started. You will need to:

Confirm the meaning of each command byte (0x21, 0x4E, 0x4B, etc.).
Determine if any additional security or checksumming is needed.
Handle the final “transfer exit” or “reboot” steps.
